<h1>Multisite approach for django</h1>
<p>In order to implement Django instance that could serve multiple sites per instance with different users and permissions per site. I propose either of the two approaches to fix Django.</p>
<p>Additionally different sites should have possibility of having different media root and url, since these represent the site media. Here we assume that installed apps are same for each site, so the static url and root can be left as global.</p>
<div class="section" id="using-methods-get-request-request">
<h2>1. Using methods <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">get_request_*(request)</span></tt></h2>
<p>It would be <strong>required</strong> to implement following:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
get_request_site_id(request)
get_request_media_root(request)
get_request_media_url(request)
</pre>
<p>And at least a another backend method (if not altered completly see below):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
get_user_request(user_id, request=None)
</pre>
<p>And replace the auth middleware's (<tt class="docutils literal">django.contrib.auth.get_user()</tt>) auth backend <tt class="docutils literal">`get_user()</tt> call with <tt class="docutils literal">get_user_request()</tt> if backend implements it (the backwards compatible way).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-middleware">
<h2>2. Using middleware</h2>
<p>It is tedious to type <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">get_request_*(request)</span></tt> calls since one needs them almost <em>always</em> in <em>all</em> views if apps were to use sites.</p>
<p>So simply add the <tt class="docutils literal">site_id</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">media_root</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">media_url</tt> to the request object in middleware (just like the <tt class="docutils literal">request.urlconf</tt> is currently added). This is handy since it only needs one cache lookup, whereas methods require fetch from cache most of the time. Behind this middleware approach there has to be methods just like in first proposal, but user would not need to type them all the time.</p>
<p>(The auth middleware still needs to be fixed as in first proposal.)</p>
<p>In either of the proposals the per site <tt class="docutils literal">media_url</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">media_root</tt> could be accessed in templates just like before since template context processor would add them by request. Although these will considerably complicate things with model fields like <tt class="docutils literal">FileField</tt> which now would require to take in the request object always.</p>

<div class="section" id="altering-the-auth-backend-role-optional">
<h2>Altering the auth backend role. (optional)</h2>
<p>I think this module level <tt class="docutils literal">django.contrib.auth.get_user()</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">login()</tt> is currently wrong way to do things in the first place (and they are confusingly named for their behavior, see below), it cuts out the authentication backend all together.</p>
<p>It would be simpler to imagine this login / get_user as following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Saving the user to <tt class="docutils literal">request.session</tt></p>
<p>(currently handled by the module level <tt class="docutils literal">login()</tt>)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Loading user from <tt class="docutils literal">request.session</tt> (all requests after login)</p>
<p>(currently handled by the module level <tt class="docutils literal">get_user()</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">backend.get_user()</tt>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no simple way one could define own behavior for this saving and loading the user to <tt class="docutils literal">request.session</tt> in auth backends. It seems like these two should be overridable in auth backend.</p>
<p>If there were a way to define saving and loading user one could do cool stuff like:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>per site login system (saving site_id of request to session during saving and fetching it from session during loading)</li>
<li>during login caching of user permissions to session (no need to hit database after login for permissions!)</li>
</ol>
<p>One could define the saving and loading of user to session in authentication backend with simple methods like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
authbackend.save(request, user) -&gt; bool
authbackend.load(request) -&gt; user object
</pre>
<p>Then for backwards compatibility we could do:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">django.contrib.auth.login</tt> would become the caller for <tt class="docutils literal">backend.save(request, user)</tt> of course the <tt class="docutils literal">login()</tt> could still use the backend_session_key and user_id there</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">django.contrib.auth.get_user</tt> would become the caller for <tt class="docutils literal">backend.load(request)</tt></li>
</ul>
<p>Later on they could be renamed by their <em>actual role</em>, like to <tt class="docutils literal">save_to_request</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">load_from_request</tt> or something like that. (<em>Save to request</em> is a bit misleading and <em>save to session</em> is too restraining for the auth backend (auth backend needs the request object))</p>
